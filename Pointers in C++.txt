
What are pointers?

        => Pointers are variables which can store addresses

        => Pointers help in dynamic memory allocation , implementation amd managing 
            complex data structure  which are allocated memory dynamically , optimized  
            use of memory and also allow for call-by-refference function calls.

        => Pointers makes it possible  to pass  the address  of a data  structure  rather than he entire structure to the function.

        => A pointer variable is preceded  by (*) symbol
                Example :  int *ptr; 
                        char  *str


*** Some type of pointers ***

        ==> Void Pointer : Special type of pointer where it is not associated  to any data type . this is a general purpose ponter .

        ==> Null Pointer : A pointer that points to nothing.
        ==> Danfling Pointer : A pointer that  points to a memory location  that has been deallocated.  

        ==> Wild Pointer : An uninitialised pointer is a wild pointer.   

        **** What is Dynamic memory allocation ?*****
        ==> Usually , all memory allocated to variables is done automatially and  that  memory  is also  released automatially .

        ==> dynamic memory allocation  allows  for manual allocation / de-allocation of memory 

        ==> dynamically allocated memory is allocated on heap .

        ==> Since memory is represented symbolically using pointers, the oprators involving dynamic memory  allocation work on pointers.

        ==> new is used  to allocate memory dynamically 

        ==> Delete is ued to release the allocation memory .
